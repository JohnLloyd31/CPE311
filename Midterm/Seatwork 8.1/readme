Throughout this program, I really improved my data manipulation and analytical abilities. I experimented with querying data to extract particular information and combining datasets to smoothly combine data from numerous sources. In addition, I improved my skills in conducting numerous dataframe operations, such as filtering, selecting, sorting, and converting data, which are essential for data cleaning and preprocessing. Aggregating data to create statistical metrics such as total, mean, and median became second nature, allowing me to obtain a better understanding of datasets. In addition, I studied time series analysis, learning how to discern trends, identify seasonality, and recognize patterns throughout time. These newly acquired abilities have enabled me to successfully handle and analyze data, allowing me to unearth useful insights and make educated decisions based on previous data trends.
